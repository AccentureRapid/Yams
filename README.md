YAMS
=======
**YAMS** (Yet Another Microservices Solution) is a library that can be used to deploy and host microservices in Azure. It offers the following features:
* Quick deployments of Azure services (~1minute). 
* Sharing infrastructure (multiple microservices can be deployed to the same cloud service). 
* Versioning of microservices, quick updates, reverts, etc. 

As long as your service can be started with an **exe**, you can deploy it with YAMS (see the documentation to learn how you can pass arguments to your *exe*).

Please read the documentation below for more information.
